## 🚨 The Problem

South African hospitals lose **R3,200 per day** per ICU bed due to inefficient turnover. Nurses track bed status on WhatsApp and whiteboards because existing systems don't match their workflow.

## 💡 The Solution

BedFlow SA bridges the gap between how nurses think ("this bed is blocked by family") and how systems work (database status fields). Using an **ontology-first approach** inspired by Palantir Foundry, we translate real-world hospital operations into actionable insights.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Real-time bed status tracking** - Live updates from MQTT sensors and manual inputs
- **Semantic status modeling** - Understands "blocked by family" vs just "occupied"
- **Revenue impact dashboard** - See money lost per minute for problematic beds
- **WhatsApp notifications** - Alerts where nurses actually look
- **Offline-first mobile** - Works during load shedding and network issues
- **POPIA compliant** - Full audit trail for South African healthcare regulations

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bedflow-sa.git
cd bedflow-sa

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Start the entire stack
docker-compose up -d

# Access the application
# Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
# API: http://localhost:8055
# Analytics: http://localhost:8000
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
MQTT Sensors → Airbyte → DuckDB → dbt (Semantic Layer) → Directus API → Retool Dashboard
                ↑                                              ↓
            HL7/DHIS2                                   WhatsApp Notifications
```

### Core Technologies

- **Data Pipeline**: Airbyte + DuckDB + dbt
- **Semantic Layer**: Custom ontology models in dbt
- **API**: Directus (headless CMS)
- **Frontend**: Retool (internal tools)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket + MQTT
- **Infrastructure**: Docker on Hetzner (Cape Town)

## 📊 Semantic Model Example

Instead of complex SQL joins, nurses can query:
```javascript
// What they think
"Show me beds blocking discharge"

// What the system understands
Bed.where(status: 'discharge_approved')
   .and(still_occupied: true)
   .and(duration > '30 minutes')
```

## 🔧 Development

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- 4GB RAM minimum
- MQTT broker access (for live data)

### Project Structure

### Testing

```bash
# Test MQTT connectivity

# Run dbt tests
docker-compose run dbt test

# Load test (100 concurrent users)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up
```

## 📈 Current Results

From our pilot at [Hospital Name]:
